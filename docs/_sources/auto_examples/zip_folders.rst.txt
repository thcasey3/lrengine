.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-23

.. code-block:: default

    path = "../path/to/parent/directory"

Create the start object, create a directory_map, and make a frame from the directory_map with depth of 1 consisting only of folders. This means the names column of the frame consists of the names of the folders that reside at the given path,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-31

.. code-block:: default

    lsobject = ls.start(directory=path)
    lsobject.map_directory()
    lsobject.map_to_frame(depth=1, kind="folders")

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-35

Scan through the names of the folders collected in the frame and create zip files of the contents,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-39

    [
        shutil.make_archive(os.path.join(path, name), "zip", os.path.join(path, name))
