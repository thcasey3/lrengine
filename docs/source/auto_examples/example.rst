lrengine Template
=================

This Template serves as an example layout for a script using lrengine.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-13

Import lrengine and any other packages that may be needed for your function,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 13-17

.. code-block:: default

    import lrengine as lr

    # import numpy as np
    # etc.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 20-21

Set the path to a parent directory,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-22

.. code-block:: default

    path = "../path to parent directory"

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-28

Define a function that accepts the parent directory and any additional arguments in the form of a dictionary and
returns a list of outputs. The list must have a single value for each member of the list and have a **'len()'**
equal to the list of **'classifiers'** given during the instantiation of the object below.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-37

.. code-block:: default

    def function_handle(directory, args_dict):

        # insert code that acts on each file or sub-directory of directory and makes two floats or ints
        # output1 =
        # output2 =

        return [output1, output2]



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-41

Instantiate the **'lrobject'**,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 41-53

.. code-block:: default

    lrobject = lr.start(
        path,
        patterns=[],  # enter any patterns in the file or folder names to use as classifiers, e.g. ["sample1", "sample2"]
        skip=[],  # enter any sub-strings in the names of file folders that should be skipped, e.g. ["blank_run"]
        classifiers=[
            "output1",
            "output2",
        ],  # these are the column names corresponding to the function outputs
        function=function_handle,  # complete the function above
        function_args={},  # enter any arguments required by function_handle, e.g. {"skiprows": 0}
        date_format="YYYYMMDD",  # (optional) give the format of any date strings in the file or folder names
    )

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-58

Pass the **'lrobject'** to the user defined function to add **'frame'** to the **'lrobject'**,
then print the **'head()'** of **'frame'**,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-60

.. code-block:: default

    lrobject.drive()
    print(lrobject.frame.head())

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-64

Add to **'lrobject'** a dictionary that is a map of the parent directory,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-65

.. code-block:: default

    lrobject.map_directory()

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-72

Create a seaborn.scatterplot correlating the two outputs. Replace **'None'** for hue with date_delta if it exists in
your **'frame'**, or maybe with a third output if you have more than two. The **'seaborn_args'** dictionary should have
keys that are the arguments that would be given to **seaborn.scatterplot** and any allowed values according to seaborn
docs,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-73

.. code-block:: default

    lrobject.sea(seaborn_args={"x": "output1", "y": "output2", "hue": None, "s": 100})
