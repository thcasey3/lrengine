===========

This example demonstrates zipping the subfolders of a parent directory.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 13-14

Import lrengine, import shutil for creating the zip files, and import os for defining paths,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-18

.. code-block:: default

    import lrengine as lr
    import shutil
    import os


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-22

Set the path to a parent directory full of folders you would like to zip,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-23

.. code-block:: default

    path = "../path/to/parent/directory"

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 27-28

Create the start object, create a directory_map, and make a frame from the directory_map with depth of 1 and only consisting of folders. The means the names of the frame are a list of folders that are in the given path,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-31

.. code-block:: default

    lrobject = lr.start(directory=path)
    lrobject.map_directory()
    lrobject.map_to_frame(depth=1, kind="folders")

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-35

Loop over the names of the frame and create zip files from the corresponding directories,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-39

.. code-block:: default

    [
        shutil.make_archive(os.path.join(path, name), "zip", os.path.join(path, name))
        for name in lrobject.frame.name
